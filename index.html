<h1>Welcome to my Github portfolio!</h1>
<p>
<i>Note: I have done almost no coding aside from a website building class 3 semesters ago that I barely managed to pass, even now I still feel like I learned nothing because of how grueling coding is to me. I apologize for the sloppy website in advance.</i>
</p>
<h2>About Me </h2>  
    <p>I am in my third year of College, majoring in Digital Media Game Design. Coding is something I do not like to do, even the "simple" stuff that I am taught I still struggle alot with trying to learn, albeit this is a major part of game design. My love for game design comes more with 3D modelling and animations in programs like Blender, the programming side of things is something I do not look forward to do but know is still required of the classes.

<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<ol>
<li> Fork (copy) <a href="https://github.com/ekjphd/DIG3171">This whole Repository</a>, then you can just edit the content with your own work, creating your own portfolio!
<li> <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/f082453c-cde9-489e-b412-801d641884e5">Start here for Github basics</a>
<li> index.html = your site's home page
<li> You can edit the HTML files directly on GitHub.
<li> "Commit" means save. Don’t forget to save!
<li> Preview is a great way to check before saving.
<li> After you click “commit changes…” it will ask you to describe your changes. It will auto-fill this, so feel free to just click “commit changes” and not worry about notes about what you did.
<li> Make any changes you’d like to show off your coding skills!
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create or Edit Files</h2>
<li> To create a new file, click the “Add file” button and select “Create new file”.
<li> To edit an existing file, navigate to the file and click the pencil icon (✏️) in the top right corner of the file view.
<li> Make Your Changes
<li> Use the GitHub editor to make your changes. You can write and edit Markdown files directly in the browser.
<li> Save Your Changes
<li> After making your changes, scroll down to the “Commit changes” section.
<li> It will ask you for a commit message describing your changes, but you can just accept the auto-generated description (this is not a big deal).
<li> Make sure “Commit directly to the main branch” is chosen (it should be by default) and click “Commit changes.”
  </li>
