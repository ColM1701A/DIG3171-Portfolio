I used both Voyant and Copilot to search and analyze the following link: [Kennedy Speech Website](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/annual-message-the-congress-the-state-the-union-4)

Voyant Results:

This is the conversation I had with Copilot on the same subject:

Prompt: Use this link to view and analyze the speech hosted on the website. Summarize the speech for it's overall purpose and meaning. https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/236917

Copilot: The speech titled "Remarks on the 750th Anniversary of the Founding of Berlin" by President Ronald Reagan, delivered on June 12, 1987, serves as a powerful reaffirmation of American solidarity with Berlin and a celebration of the city's resilience, history, and symbolic importance in the global struggle for freedom.
Overall Purpose and Meaning
1. Celebration of Berlin’s Legacy: Reagan honors Berlin’s 750-year history, recognizing its cultural, intellectual, and political contributions to the world. He highlights the city's enduring spirit and its role as a beacon of freedom, especially in the context of Cold War tensions.
2. Affirmation of U.S.–Berlin Relations: The speech emphasizes the deep and longstanding ties between the United States and Berlin. Reagan praises the American military and civilian presence in the city and reaffirms the U.S. commitment to remain in Berlin as long as needed to support its freedom and security.
3. Tribute to Berliners’ Courage: Reagan recounts stories of Berliners and Americans who exemplified bravery and dedication—such as the pilots of the Berlin Airlift, the Trümmerfrauen (women who rebuilt the city after WWII), and defectors from East Berlin. These stories serve to illustrate the human cost and heroism behind Berlin’s survival and growth.
4. Symbolism of Freedom and Unity: Berlin is portrayed as a symbol of liberty and democratic values. Reagan underscores that the city’s division is a stark reminder of the ideological divide between freedom and oppression, and he calls for continued vigilance and unity in defending democratic ideals.
5. Optimism for the Future: The speech concludes with a hopeful vision for Berlin’s future, asserting that the ideals of freedom and openness associated with West Berlin are gaining global recognition. Reagan expresses confidence that Berlin will continue to inspire the world and play a vital role in shaping a better future.

Would you like a shorter version of this summary or a quote-based breakdown of key moments from the speech?

Voyant was incredibly accurate when presented with a URL to a speech by President John F. Kennedy. The speech itself is a state of the union address that I believe should be easy for both tools to analyze. Voyant pointed out the number of times certain words and phrases were used, the number of different phrases and even displayed how easily readable the speech was. Above all else, Voyant displayed what the speech was. Copilot is a completely different story. While it managed to give a thorough and detailed summary of what it analyzed, it managed to analyze the wrong speech. Copilot instead created a summary on a speech by Ronald Reagan, to which I am unsure is even a real speech. This analysis of both tools has shown me that I should choose my tools carefully as not all of them will be able to accurately help me.
